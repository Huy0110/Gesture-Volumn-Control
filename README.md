# Gesture-Volumn-Control
This is an AI project, written in Python. It can allow users to control the volume of the computer through hand gestures. Specifically, it will rely on the distance between the tip of the index finger and the tip of the thumb to control the computer volume. When you move your index finger and thumb away from each other, the computer volume will be louder and vice versa.
